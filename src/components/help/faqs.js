  answer: [
    'Glare.fm is the prerelease app for The M Machine\'s upcoming Glare album. Glare.fm is an experiment all about giving music to someone else, person-to-person, and watching as the music spreads across the world. Here\'s how it works:',
    'You can login at glare.fm anytime, but to listen to music, you\'ll have to get access from someone who’s already unlocked it.',
    'In order to unlock glare.fm, someone who already has access must share it with you IN PERSON.',
    'Once activated you\'ll have four songs to listen to, and you can unlock two more each time you share it with someone else.',
    'You\'ll also be able to follow the album as it travels across the globe, and track your personal influence on its spread.',

  title: 'Why did you make glare.fm?',
  answer: [
    'When we finished writing our new album, Glare, we knew we wanted to try something special for the release — and we kept coming back to the idea that we wanted our listeners to share the album with each other in person, over a conversation. As we started to develop the mechanics of glare.fm, it became clear that there was a magic in knowing that the music began its life with us, and made its way — one human at a time — to you.'

  title: 'Why can\'t I give or receive the album?',
  answer: [
    'Glare.fm uses geolocation to make giving and receiving the album in-person possible. In order to use glare.fm, you must enable geolocation in your browser. There are a number of different ways to turn geolocation on and off, depending on your browser.',
